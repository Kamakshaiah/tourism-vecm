The results implied that the analyzed variables became stationary at their first differences. The panel cointegration tests indicated the presence of a long-term equilibrium relationship among these four analyzed variables. Results from the VECM Granger causality tests suggested that the bidirectional short-term causalities were statistically confirmed between gross domestic product (GDP) and tourism. Additionally, we found that some unidirectional short-run causalities existed running from energy consumption to other analyzed variables and bidirectional long-run causalities existed between CO2 emissions and GDP, CO2 emissions and tourism, and GDP and tourism. Moreover, we also found the existence of unidirectional long-term causalities running from energy consumption to other analyzed variables. Based on these findings, we highlighted some key policy implications to develop China’s sustainable tourism. © The Author(s) 2020.",China; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; error correction; panel data; tourism economics

The objective of this chapter is to investigate and analyze the contribution of tourism sector in the economic development in Cambodia. After the cessation of conflict and the start of establishing political stability in 1993, the tourism sector has started to be a significant and very dynamic engine of economic growth and generator of foreign exchange revenues in Cambodia. For this reason, this study covers the period after the early 1990s when Cambodia opened its door to the world. In this study, the relationship between Cambodian tourism receipts and gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is analyzed. Johansen co-integration test was performed to identify whether there was a long-term relationship between the variables. Then vector error correction mechanism (VECM) was used to identify the existence of short-run relationship between variables. Finally, residual tests were performed to check if the model is stable and desirable. E-views 8 statistical program is used for data analysis. According to the results of the study, Johansen co-integration test verifies that GDP, tourism receipts, and export revenues have long-term association. The VEC Granger Causality/Block Exogeneity Wald Tests show that the causality from tourism receipts to GDP is statistically significant. And also this study shows that the tourism policies and the tourism revenues are more effective on the GDP than the export policies and the revenues. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

So, to see if increased energy usage, tourism, and economic growth jointly raise carbon productivity in Kuwait, this study uses a vector error correction strategy to look at the years 1995–2020. Predictions about how sustainable tourism will affect energy efficiency, and carbon productivity improvements are also an excellent way to learn more about this subject. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the air increases, tourism will go down by 0.13 percent. Inverse cointegration is the term for this phenomenon. However, the vector error correction model showed that carbon emissions go down as the economy grows and people pay more attention to how much energy they use. Nevertheless, Granger’s theory of cause and effect says that carbon emissions, energy use, and economic growth can only lead to more tourism in one way. © 2023 The Author(s).

It is also one of the main economic sectors in attracting and generating foreign revenue, acting in a similar manner to an export industry and accounts for seven percent of global foreign revenue as an export industry. For this study, Malayisa was selected as the study region. In Malaysia, the sector plays an important role in the growth and development of the economy in support of traditional economic sectors. The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship of the dependent variable, namely the tourism sector, with economic growth, political stability and changes in the exchange rate, as independent variables. Malaysia is classified by the UN as an upper-middle income developing country. This study followed a quantitative research approach using an econometric model, with time series data from 1996 to 2017. The relationships between the variables were analysed using descriptive statistics, the Johansen cointegration model, the Vector Error Correction (VECM) and the Granger causality analysis. The results indicated that there are both long and short-run relationships between the variables. The tourism sector is significantly affected by the predicting variables and changes in these variables should be monitored and taken into account in policy formulation. A number of policy recommendations that could potentially contribute to the extension of the role of tourism in development include improved stability regarding politics and the local currency. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",

We established four plausible hypotheses and verified by employing the autoregressive distributed lags model and Granger causality based on vector error correction model (VECM). Considering the cointegration relationship between the variables, the outcomes of autoregressive distributed lags suggested that tourism increases economic growth, and economic growth induces tourism in the long-run, thus confirming tourism-led development, and growth-led tourism hypothesis; similarly, the tourism generates CO2e emissions, which supported the tourism-led emission hypothesis. The role of renewable energy consumption found to be a significant moderator, thus helping to enrich tourism, accelerating economic growth, and combating CO2e in the country. VECM causal results indicated the significant bidirectional causal linkages between tourism and economic growth—another causality found between tourism and CO2e. There is one-way causality from FDI and renewable energy towards income simultaneously.

Design - The design of this study is based on analysing quarterly data on incomes, house prices, net financial assets, financial derivatives and employee stock options in order to measure the link between wealth and tourism departures in selected countries-Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Slovenia and the United Kingdom (UK)-with individual-country time series that span the period from 2000 to 2018. Methodology - Granger causality in the relationship between income and wealth inputs and tourism departures has been examined using the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL), the bounds test for cointegration, the vector error correction model (VECM), and long- and short-term (as well as joint) causality. Findings - The findings showed the existence of cointegration and a direct effect on the relationship between various sources of wealth/income and tourism departures in both the long- and short-run, and jointly, only in the case of Austria. House price, net financial asset and stock option causality results essentially showed unidirectional causality that runs from that form of wealth to tourism departures in the case of Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Slovenia and the UK, thus providing extensive support for the wealth effect-tourism link in certain countries. Originality of the research - The originality of this paper stems from the fact that it offers the first analysis of the relationship between various forms of income/wealth and tourism departures in selected European Union (EU) countries. The findings of this study suggest that a bounds test for cointegration due to data constraints should be taken into account when examining the link between the wealth effect and tourism in country time series analysis. © 2020 University of Rijeka.

It is a challenge for developing countries to increase total reserves in order to make timely payments for the imports. This paper explored the dynamics between total reserves, financial development index, improved sanitation, renewable energy, trade openness, and tourism by using panel data from 1995 to 2015 in 19 Asia Cooperation Dialogue member countries, divided into three panels with respect to income. Prior to empirical analysis, the stationarity in each variable series was explored by using four unit root tests. The Kao cointegration test confirmed the long-run association between the selected variables. The results of vector error correction model confirmed the long run causality for total reserves, financial development, renewable energy, sanitation, and tourism in high income countries (HICs); total reserves, financial development, and trade in upper middle income countries (UMICs); and financial development, renewable energy, and sanitation in lower middle income countries (LMICs). The total reserves revealed the growth hypothesis with tourism (HICs), sanitation (HICs, UMICs), and financial development (LMICs); conservation hypothesis with trade (HICs), financial development (UMICs), and renewable energy (UMICs); and feedback hypothesis with renewable energy (HICs), and sanitation (LMICs). The fully modified ordinary least square was used to estimate the long run elasticity coefficients. The increase in total reserves due to 1% increase in sanitation was 4.704% and 2.941% in UMICs and LMICs, respectively. The increase in total reserves by 1% increase in tourism was 1.079%, 0.521%, and 0.413% in HICs, UMICs, and LMICs, respectively. The increase in total reserves was 1.462% and 0.814% due to 1% increase in financial development and trade openness, respectively in HICs. The country-wise analysis also supported the panel results. The increase in total reserves was found due to increase in improved sanitation (14 countries), tourism (9 countries, renewable energy (7 countries), trade (6 countries), and financial development (5 countries). The policymakers should primarily focus on improved sanitation, and tourism followed by financial development, trade, and renewable energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Commerce; Developing countries; Error correction; Hybrid integrated circuits; Sanitation; Elasticity coefficients; Energy; FMOLS; Middle-income countries; Ordinary least squares; Tourism; VECM; Vector error correction model; Finance

Design/methodology/approach: Using time-series data from 1995 to 2019, this study applies vector error correction model to analyse the impact of ICT infrastructure in the short- and long term. Findings: The results of analysis show that although ICT infrastructure does not affect the number of international tourists in the short term, it positively contributes to tourism development in the long term. In addition, the results also show that in the short term, consumer prices have a negative impact on tourist arrivals while having a positive effect in the long run. Research limitations/implications: This study only considers the impact of ICT infrastructure on the whole without going into each factor reflecting different aspects of the ICT infrastructure. Moreover, this research only stops at the pre-pandemic period, so it has not shown the role of ICT infrastructure in travel and tourism demand during severe pandemic periods. Practical implications: The research results are an essential basis to support the Vietnamese Government’s strategy to pursue an accelerated investment policy in ICT infrastructure, especially investment in the tourism and hotel industries. On the other hand, the research results also create more motivation and confidence for managers and operators of destinations in Vietnam to invest in ICT infrastructure and apply ICT in management. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature on tourism–ICT linkages in an emerging tourism market directly between ICT infrastructure and international arrivals with a dynamic time series–based approach that considers the dynamics in the tourist demand identification model. In addition, this study used consumer price index to assess the impact of price on tourist demand instead of using the exchange rate or using the relative prices between the origin and destination countries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This work concentrate mainly onthe relations betweenair pollution andsociety in the context ofaveragehousehold income and expenditures.Material and methods:Thestudy examines the causal relationships between expenditures on health, sport, and tourism, household incomes and air pollution across selected polish voivodships in years 2004– 2019.A notable feature of this study is that it uses annual data disaggregated into quarterly data to obtain robust empirical results through avoiding a sample size problem.The study applies the vector error correction model (VECM) to analyze the long-term and short-term relationship between six variables, where PM2.5(particulate matters) andCO (carbon monoxide) represents atmospheric pollution andhousehold budget is represented by disposable income and expenditures on health, sport, and tourism.Results:Pollution cause direct and indirect pressure on economy, as well as on individual household budget. First, the empirical results shows that air pollution directly affects health, especially when the concentration of harmful dusts and aerosols in the air is high.Second, the air pollution influence the expenses on health indirectly, through the state of health, where the individuals are forced to make expenses to treat the disease caused by air pollution, or for the prevention of potential diseases caused by air pollution.Third, the air pollution also cause the pressure on sport expenses and tourism expenses of household. Conclusion:Atmospheric pollution can impact economic outcomes, as well the atmospheric pollution can be driven by economic activity on different levels of aggregation.Air quality is also an important factor for making decisions about leisure and recreation. Sport activity, as a way of spending free time, has positive effect on health. Physical activity alsoinfluencethe reduction of health expenditure in long term, butalso has a potential to increase the expenditures on sport and recreation. © JPES.",

The inadequate examination of hospitality price comparison is investigated between two non-neighbouring Adriatic east coast countries–Slovenia and Montenegro–using the euro. Hospitality prices are an essential indicator in hospitality markets, destination marketing and management planning. Using 73 monthly time-series data for the economic crisis period from December 2008 to December 2014, this period covers one shock in a series. One of the key managerial features of cointegrated spatial hospitality price spread was that Montenegro followed Slovenian hospitality prices. Hospitality prices in Montenegro and Slovenia tend to be weakly integrated into the long term and seasonally driven in the short term. In addition, the econometric experimentation has given a theoretical novelty for underpinned and undermined tourism economy modelling in normalities. This state-of-the-art econometric feature is included in a customary vector error correction model (VECM). Robust applied results recognise that hospitality prices in Montenegro are domestic driven and in Slovenia Eurozone driven.

In turn, a rise of trade openness is expected to affect on the tourism industry. This study investigates the causal relationship between trade openness, outbound tourism expenses, and inbound tourism receipts to explore whether or not trade openness benefits the tourism sector of Korea. Design/Methodology/Approach – We utilized the vector error correction (VECM) model, directed acrylic graph (DAG), and Impulse Response Function (IRF) methods to examine those relationships. While VECM allows to figure out the predictive causation, DAG can test the contemporaneous relationship. IRF allows to find the different effect of trade openness on outbound tourism expenses and inbound tourism receipts. Findings – Our results for VECM and DAG demonstrate that there are causalities of trade openness on inbound tourism receipts and outbound tourism expenses. To evaluate the effect of trade openness on domestic tourism sector in terms of economics and sustainability, we perform the IRF. Results of IRF show that trade openness has a positive and negative effect on outbound tourism expenses and inbound tourism receipts, re-spectively.

Thus, initiatives are necessary to prevent environmental damage that could have a corresponding detrimental effect on the tourism industry itself and slow down the country’s economic growth. This study utilises a vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the relationship between polluting emissions, GDP levels, and tourism flows in France to test the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for the period 1995–2014. Additionally, based on a joint analysis of long-run parameters and causality links, appropriate policy strategies are proposed to promote robust and sustainable long-run economic growth.                          © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",France; economic growth; emission inventory; environmental economics; estimation method; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; sustainability; sustainable development; tourism economics; tourist destination

Despite the political, economic and military crises, which dominated in the examined period, tourist arrivals to Greece from USA have continued to grow slowly.

In 2007, the world's travel and tourism industry contributed (directly and indirectly) US$5,390 billion (or 10.4%) to global Gross Domestic Product, and the industry generated more than 231 million jobs or 8.3% of total world employment (World Travel & Tourism Council 2008). The real average annual growth of world tourism has exceeded the global economic growth during the period 2004-2007. In 2008-2009, the challenging economic environment and stock market volatility have a negative impact on tourism in wealth generation, job creation and economic diversification for many economies worldwide. Tourism is arguably the largest industry in NZ. In 2007, the tourism industry contributed 9.1% (NZ$14.1 billion) to the country's gross domestic product and generated about 10% of full-time employment (Statistics New Zealand, 2008). The ""100% Pure"" branding has been a very successful marketing campaign, especially for adventure tourism. The global recession and swine flu have adversely affected international visitor arrivals to New Zealand. Furthermore, the Ministry of Tourism has revised down tourist arrival growth forecast from 4.0 percent per annum to 2.5 percent per annum for the next seven years. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between hospitality-tourism stock prices and macroeconomic factors in New Zealand using cointegration analysis and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The former establishes the long run realtionships between stock prices and macroeconomic factors and the latter identifies the short run dynamics between prices and macroeconomic varaibles. Interestingly, the specification of VECM in this context is also closely related to empirical models implied by the Asset Pricing Theory (APT). Therefore, the results from this paper also provide valuable insight into the pricing of firms where the main values come from the service that they provide rather than their physical assets. The results provided empirical evidence on the existence of relationships between the stock returns of tourism companies and macro-economic variables. This should provide invaluable insight for governmental policy makers when designing monetary and fiscal policies as well as executives from these individual firms to forecast the stock returns of their companies.",Costs; Economic and social effects; Employment; Factor analysis; Industry; Investments; Arbitrage pricing theories; Asset pricing; Average annual growth; Co-integration; Cointegration analysis; Economic diversification; Economic environment; Empirical evidence; Empirical model; Fiscal policies; Full-time employment; Global economic growth; Global economies; Global recession; Governmental policies; Gross domestic products; Growth forecast; Job creation; Marketing campaign; New zealand; Physical assets; Statistics New Zealand; Stock market volatility; Stock performance; Stock price; Stock returns; Tourism industry; Tourism stocks; Travel and tourism; Vector error correction model; Economics

Much of this literature revolves around using aggregate measures of economic growth and tourism arrivals to test the tourism-led growth hypothesis. However, this paper aims to investigate the causality between growth in tourism and the expansion of services in Thailand. It is posited that evaluating the causal relationship between tourism and the development of the service sector is relevant since the service sector is a primary driver for economic growth and recovery. For this purpose, a Granger causality test was performed based on Toda-Yamamoto and a vector error correction model (VECM) using aggregated and disaggregated service production index (SPI) and international tourist arrivals. The findings show that causality runs from the development of the production of services as a whole to tourism growth. In turn, the hotel industry benefits from expanding international tourist arrivals. Evidence was also found of bidirectional causality between tourism growth and indices reflecting the production of real estate, transportation, and telecommunications. The findings suggest that the contribution of tourism growth to the production of services may depend on how integrated tourism is with the service sector. Therefore, it is necessary that strategic partnerships between tourism authorities and private stakeholders (i.e., telecommunications firms) be created and strengthened. © Silpakorn University.

The data set has been acquired from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, and the time span of the data set takes into account a 20-year time period, from 2000 to 2019. To determine the strength of the above-mentioned relationship previous models that have been used for this research are mainly VAR (vector auto-regression) and VECM (vector error correction) models. The VAR and VECM models have been conducted together with the Granger causality test. The internal revenue generated from tourism-related activities is taken as being the main indicator for the tourism industry, while economic growth is determined by GDP (gross domestic product). We support the above-mentioned notion, as we found that a strong relationship exists between the development of the tourism industry and economic growth. Moreover, our analysis also indicates that this industry has a major impact on long-term economic growth in the region as well. This study thus provides further support to the existing literature on the topic of tourism and the impact that tourism-related activities have upon economic development and growth. The existence and the impact of tourism-related activities upon long-term economic growth were confirmed by the results of the VAR models. At the same time, the unidirectional results of VECM models have confirmed the existence of economic growth in the short term. In our case, the cardinal relationship between the development of the tourism industry and the economic growth in the Beijing region of China have managed to provide strong empirical support to the earlier stated notions and to the literature alike. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses rigorous dynamic panel data analysis, namely, a Panel Vector Autoregressive Error Correction model, which takes into account both dynamic and endogenous relationships in the tourism-inequality nexus. Findings: The results provide strong support that tourism development has an income inequality reducing effect (albeit relatively small with a reported elasticity of 0.05). Subsamples analysis reveals that the impact of tourism on income inequality varies and is relatively larger in developing economies and those tourist-dependent economies, as compared to developed economies. In fact, it is reported that a 1% increase in tourism development reduces income inequality by 0.46% for developing and 0.56% for tourist-dependent economies as compared to only 0.02% in developed economies. It is further observed that tourism may affect income inequality indirectly via economic growth. Originality/value: This paper attempts to supplement the dearth literature on the tourism-inequality nexus by analyzing subsamples from a large data set while also using a dynamic panel data framework. The potential indirect effect of tourism on inequality via the economic growth channel is also explored. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Previous empirical studies have mainly applied econometric models to find and characterize the relationship between tourism development and real GDP in the long run. While a few studies fail to corroborate this relationship due to its complex nature, most studies confirm the Tourism-Led Growth Hypothesis (TLGH) that links the economic growth on islands to further development in the tourism sector. This paper explores the validity of the tourism-led growth hypothesis for Madeira using annual data from 1978 to 2019. The results of the cointegration tests point to a positive long-run relationship between tourism receipts and economic growth. Moreover, the analysis of the short-run dynamics, based on a VECM reveal that this long-run linear relationship is stable. However, we need to the taking into account the existence of structural breaks, and a change of regime, and therefore sources of instability. From a “causality” point of view, the main finding suggests that there is long-run causality running from tourism to GDP but not the opposite.

Unfortunate the City of Cape Town local municipality is dominated by poverty, inequality, stagnant economic growth and unemployment. Despite these challenges, researchers contend that tourism is a vehicle to local economic development. Thus, the purpose of the paper was to examine the influence of tourism on LED in the Cape town city municipality from 1994-2018. In achieving this purpose, the study used a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) time series analysis and the Granger Causality analysis. The results show a positive relationship between exports, number of tourists and local economic development. Contrawise, tourism receipts are negatively related to local economic development. Notable is that local economic development and tourism receipts have a positive relationship in the short-run. The study therefore recommends the enforcement of a tourism policy that specifically benefits the residents more than the business people and entrepreneurs. © 2020 AJHTL /Author/s.",

The current study aims to verify that the global cruise tourism industry can be sustainable through its inherent power for long-term balanced convergence within the industry and can flexibly respond to external shocks such as COVID-19. This study applies the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to estimate the long-term balance function that determines the number of world cruise tourists. This study reveals that the number of world cruise tourists finally converges to long-term balance if the number of world cruise tourists at present is lower than the one at long-term equilibrium. In summary, the results of the VECM in the present study suggest the presence of an “invisible hand” in the global cruise tourism industry converging to a long-term balance. A few previous studies have suggested ways to increase global cruise tourists and promote the cruise tourism industry through qualitative methods, however, little research has estimated the decision function of the number of cruise tourists at a long-term equilibrium point. This study shows the dynamic characteristics of the cruise tourism market using the VECM. © 2021 by the authors.

A plausible explanation for such a finding may reside in the fact that the bulk of FDI flows in the non-tourism sectors while domestic investment predominates in the tourism sector in Mauritius.

The objectives of this study, thus, are to determine: the long-run relationship; the long-run and short-run Granger causality; and the long-run triangular Granger causality between economic growth and tourism receipts corresponding to selected macroeconomic variables such as government tourism expenditure, physical capital, education, health and exports as control variables. The long-run Granger causality in vector error correction model (VECM) shows economic growth, tourism receipts and health complement each other (bidirectional causality), while unidirectional causalities are found between government tourism expenditure, physical capital, education and exports to economic growth. In addition, enhancing physical capital, education, health, exports and government tourism expenditure precede tourism receipts; all these in turn indirectly lead to economic growth, thus witnessing triangular relationships among them. © 2013, © 2013 National Council of Applied Economic Research.",

The data vector is integrated by chain indices with the constant base January 2000 = 100. A stochastic trend and shocks are covered in the analysis. Shocks are linked to the European Union accession, and economic crisis following with overwhelmed tourist arrivals. The contribution of the research is two-fold. First, the equations for at most normal distributed variables of labour productivity and real wages in tourism are exposed. Three spatial cointegration relations confirm labour productivity integrity of the regional tourism market. Second, pair-wise causalities indicate one cointegrated vector for labour productivity, which drives real gross wages in tourism sub-industries. These results suggest that for a higher non-seasonal assessment of real gross wage, the labour productivity should rise, i.e. less workers, more robotization or more tourist arrivals with better quality solutions. These findings are at most important to be implemented after the COVID-19 infection crisis with expected restructurings and digital transformation in the tourism industry. © 2020 The Author(s).

Results from the aggregated model indicate that all variables return to their long-run equilibrium relationships and unidirectional causal relationship is reported from tourism expenditure to real output in the short-run. Moreover, results from the disaggregated model imply strong bidirectional causal links between growth and business travel and tourism spending (BTS) in the longrun and unidirectional causal links from leisure travel and tourism spending (LTS) to growth and to BTS.

The aim of the current study is to assess the environmental impacts of tourism growth in Tanzania, using time series data for the period 1995–2017. It utilizes ecological footprints as a proxy for environmental damage, tourism receipt as an economic indicator, and primary energy consumption, urban population, and trade openness as control variables. The study employs Autoregressive Distributed Lag Bounds Testing, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Granger causality test for analysis and the Wild Bootstrap approach to check the accuracy of the computed statistics. The VECM Granger causality test shows that in the case of Tanzania, international tourism revenue and trade openness compact environmental degradation, while urbanization and primary energy consumption accelerate it. Besides, while long run cointegration exists among the variables, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis was not ascertained in Tanzania. Therefore, Tanzania must adopt more proactive urban planning strategies to achieve sustainable urbanization thereby improving the quality of the environment. Additionally, it is important for Tanzania to make strategic use of trade and tourism receipts, such as investment on renewable energy, to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, and improve environmental sustainability. So, the study opens new policy perspectives with wide international relevancy as outlined in the policy implication section. © 2022 The Author(s)",

Design/methodology/approach: The order of integration is tested through ADF and PP unit root tests. The robustness of unit root test is testified via structural break unit root test. Furthermore, the authors use Bayer and Hanck (2013) combined cointegration test to confirm the existence of a long-term theoretical relationship among the variables. For the robustness of cointegration analysis, the authors also employ ARDL bound testing in the presence of structural break years. Moving forward, the authors apply VECM Granger causality to find out the direction of causality. Subsequently, variance decomposition approach and impulse response function are used to distinguish leader from the followers. Findings: The unit root test shows that the order of integration is one, I(1). The cointegration analysis confirms the long-run relationship between underlying variables. The authors find inverse and significant impact of crime and exchange rate on tourism in the long run. On contrary, domestic prices play a positive and significant role to determine tourism in short and long run. Also, terrorism is found to be insignificant with negative impact. Further, the bidirectional causality between crime and tourism is observed in the long run. Similarly, unidirectional causality from terrorism to exchange and exchange rate to domestic price is observed in the short run. Originality/value: The contemporary studies on crime-tourism nexus offer limited evidence, as they frequently suffer from omitted variable bias and ignore possible endogeneity issues. This study uses vector autoregressive models to overcome these biases. Similarly, the authors accommodate the role of structural break years through their analysis. Hence, the results offer more credible evidence. Moreover, the authors contribute to the existing tourism demand literature by adding crime as a potential determinate in case of Pakistan. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
